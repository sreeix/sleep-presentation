I've been interested in process of sleep for a while but after the course I have a very clear and detailed understanding of the anatomy and functions of the brain.
I'd read books that give me a very high level understanding of sleep 
[Dreamland](http://www.amazon.com/Dreamland-Adventures-Strange-Science-Sleep/dp/0393345866/)
[Internal time](http://www.amazon.com/Internal-Time-Chronotypes-Social-Youre/dp/0674065859/)

Now I understand what SCN, where abouts it's located and why it must exist on Hypothalamus. The insights I now have about these things is not just superficial.

I have also been intersted and now more intersted in cognitive sciences and have a better understanding to taclke those subjects as well.

Thanks
