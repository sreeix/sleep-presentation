#Introduction to Neurobiology of Sleep

## Introduction to Sleep

### What is sleep?

Almost all animals sleep(all animals with CNS). Plants(1.) and bacteria(2.) do not sleep but still exhibit circardian rhythms.
It's hard to pin down what is wakefullness and  what exactly is sleep. It was thought that sleep is the absence of brain activity, but it is now known that some brain areas are very active during the sleep.

One way to think of Sleep is a state of low Motor activity(There may be brief periods of arousals) and low sensory reactivity( We can still hear and sense stuff but probably not processed. Like hearing the baby cry but not the thunderstorm) and completely reversible(which differentiates with from coma/death).

With the use of EEG we can define sleep pretty precisely. It is observed that brain produces electrical signals(due to neuronal activity probably because changes in voltage of the membranes of nerve cells) during wakefulness and during sleep. The patterns of EEG are different in those two phases and can be used to distinguish between wakefullness and sleep as well as different stages of sleep. Broadly low voltage high frequency waves. While Sleep is high voltage low frequency waves. Similarly it is also easy to distinguish between the stages of sleep with these wave plots.

### What is wakefulness
In a similar way wakefulness is equivalent to alertness and conciousness(and is the complement state of sleep). This involves the cerebral cortex to be active and ready to receive stimulus and respond to them.
Wakefulness is produced by a interaction between multiple neurotransmitter systems starting in the brainstem and ascending through the midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus and basal forebrain.



### Why is it needed?
It is extremely important and pervasive. Body takes extreme steps to drive people to get enough sleep.
Why did natural selection allow something like it to evolve and be so pervasive is an unsolved mystery. For it to be so pervasive despite the obvious disadvantages it comes with, it needs to provide some other significant advantages.

* Restoration and Recovery(3.)
* Energy Conservation.(4.)
* Brain plasiticity

#### Restoration and Recovery
There are some findings that support the theory that Sleep is needed for body to recover from the time spent waking. The onset of sleep is linked to increased levels of growth hormone secretion. Also athelethes that excersiced more ended up longer time in NREM sleep, implying that it may have something to do with the recovery after excersice.(though the total sleep does may not increase)
Sleep also plays an important role in wound healing, ie. wounds heal slower when people get less amount of sleep.  Body immune system also suffers during the lack of sleep.
There is also some research poining towards rebalance of neurotransmitters in the brain during sleep. Also pointing to this is the knowledge that Adenosine buildup in the brain leads to the feeling of tiredness and neurons in the waking state produce adinosine which may be cleared during the sleep.


#### Energy convervation Theory.

It may have evolved due to reduce the amount energy loss due to metabolism in mammals and birds. 
The (PreOptic area?)Anterior Hypothalamus which performs the equivalent of Human thermostat drops the set point of the body by about 1-2 deg. C. This leads to the body temperature drop primarily due to peripheral Vasodialation.
This mechanism is very similar to the process of hiberantion in smaller mammals. Sleep show remarkable similarities to Hibernation in it's thermo regulatory and psychological states.

#### Brain Plasticity Theory

This is a recent theory based on the observation of changes in structure and organization of brain during sleep. For example in children the amount of time spend sleeping is being linked to the brain development of individuals. Also it is well know that sleep aids learning and memory consolidation processes.


### Stages of Sleep
Based on the EEG wave forms it is easy to distinguish between REM(Rapid eye movement) sleep and NREM sleep.

#### Rem Sleep

It is a state of sleep characterized by the rapid and random movements of eyes during sleep. It shows low voltage high frequency waves on EEG.

It typically happens at the end of the NREM sleep cycle. and also involves immobilization of voluntary muscles. And also the stage where people dream vividly and remember the dreams after waking up. The Neo cortex is as active as a waking brain during this period showing similar neuronal activity. Another interesting thing to note is that is has only been observed in mamals and birds and not in Reptiles(possible evolutionary ancestors of birds)


#### NREM sleep
It consists of multiple stages of sleep, based on the EEG waves. And starting stage 1 transitions into stage 3 and 4 which is called _Slow wave sleep_ and corrsponds to deep sleep. During NREM sleep muscles are not immobilized and there is not much of eye movement, and very few dreams. There is a dominance of parasymphatic dominance("rest and digest" mode) in the NREM sleep.

##### Stages of sleep.

* Stage 1 
	Is when alpha waves make way for Theta wave, it is like relaxed wakefulness. People don't belive they have been asleep, but are transitioning into it.

* Stage 2 
	is intermediate sleep and has these strange things like Sleep Spindles( High frequency brain activity of unknown nature) and K-Complexes(induced by external activity but spontanous delta waves)

* Slow wave sleep
	is the transition to the large delta waves. And is associated with "deep sleep" and has highest arousal thresholds, and people waking up from it are very confused when woken up.

The slow wave sleep occurs in the early stages of the sleep and then disappears in the later stages. The preferential occurrence of slow wave sleep early in the night is may be because of the  sleep homeostasis affects, while the predominance of REM sleep later is associated with the circadian rhythm.

## How does it start?

Sleep processes is a quick transition from wakefulness to sleep and at the end of the sleep cycles a quick transition back to wakefulness.

There seem to be two process responsible for bringing sleep. 

* The Circardian Rhythm
	These are biological processes that  are driven by human daily clocks.
	
	The main components of this system reside in the Hypothalamus.
	** SCN. The Supra Chaismatic Nucleas. 
		It a group of nuclei in Hypothalamus that sits right over optic chaism, and receives input from retina.
		The master clock of the body, directly controlled by the vision information coming from retina. 
		It controls the Pineal Gland to secrete more or less melatonin. Melatonin secretion peaks at night and causes the onset of sleep. This mechanism controls the Sleep wake cycle.
		It also controls the other local clocks in the body.
	** VLPO . The Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus
		It is a cluster of neurons in the anterior hypothalamus on the side of optic chaism. VLPO and SCN have neuronal projections into each other and seems to play a role in circadian rhythm in mammals.
		It primarily produces the inhibitory neuro transmitter GABA which inhibits the function of arousal systems(It has projections to the arousal systems) and causes sleep
		It appears to be enervated by orexin neurons from posterior Hypothalamus that inhibit VLPO operations. Thus Orexin creats an A-B feedback system which keeps the sleep wake cycle in play and always stays in either of the two modes.
		Inhibition of VLPO by orexin neurons and activation of Arousal Systems cause the end of the sleep and wakefulness.


	
* Homeostatic sleep need (Sleep pressure)
 	Arousal systems is a name for a group of neural systems arising in brain stem and have projections throughout the cortex. They combine togather to bring about conciousness cortical activity and alerness. 
	 Reticular activating system plays a key role in regulating sleep wake transitions. It is inhibited during sleep, and activated during wakefulness.
	
	During wakefulness brain produces adinosine (byproduct from the generation of energy using ATP) Adenosine accumulates selectively in the basal forebrain and promotes the transition from wakefulness to SWS by inhibiting wakefulness-promoting basal forebrain neurons .
	Both Coffee and tea contain adenosine receptor blockers caffeine and theophyline.

Thus the Homeostatic processes and the circardian rhythm work in tandem to keep the balance between sleep and wakefulness.



### REM sleep


During sleep, an ultradian oscillator in the mesopontine junction(pontine taguntum) controls the regular alternation of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep
This means that the forebrain mechanisms modulate REM sleep the rhythm generator for REM sleep comes from the brain stem. The REM activation is happens via REM "on" neurons in the pontine taguntum that ascend into Thalamus and the cortex. These are acetocholine triggered neurons and withdrawal of certain parts of arousal system (LC- Locus coeruleus and DRN dorsal Raphe nuclei) which disinhibits these acetocholine neurons. The REM "off" neurons in the brainstem (monoaminergic)interact with each other pro create an ultradian rhythm for REM sleep. Also characteristic of REM sleep is the Rem atonia, whereby motorneurons are inhibited so that dreams are not acted out. This control happens via inhibitory projections to the spinal chord(via lower brain stem projections)
